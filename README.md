## Technologies
For the client `js` with the use of `react`. Addition of `mui` as a frontend-framework. Fetching works with `axios`. Based entirely on browser technologies. 

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- Adapt server config in [http.js](/src/http.js)
- Run `npm db:reset` on server directory
- run `npm install`

## Approach
app should run on each consultants device. Server receives and checks request and stores them in database
Works accordingly to standardises client-server approach with http requests. Is the only way to enter and work with data from a desktop pc or notebook

## Status
big-thunder-mountain is still in development.
